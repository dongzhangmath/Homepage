I am a postdoc in the Max Planck Institute for Mathematics in the Sciences in Leipzig. I am very fortunate to work with JÃ¼rgen Jost.

Before coming to MPI MiS, I got my PhD in Peking University under the guidance of Kung-Ching Chang. I am very fortunate to be advised by Prof. Chang.

My mathematical interests are mostly lie at the intersection of combinatorics, metric geometry, optimization, and nonlinear analysis.
